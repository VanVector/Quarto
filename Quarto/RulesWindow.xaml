                    The rules are quite simple. There are a 4x4 field and 16 
                    pieces. There are 4 attributes each piece has. They are height, solidness, 
                    shape and color. Each attribute can be one of two kinds (solid/hollow, 
                    big/small, black/white, square/round). The game objective 
                    is to form a line of 4 pieces with at least one common attribute. 
                    The line can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

                    The first player chooses a piece for the second player. The 
                    second player places the piece on a free game board place and 
                    chooses a piece for the first player to place. And so on. The game
                    ends when one of the players finishes a winning line and says 
                    "Quarto". Though a player may not notice the winning line but
                    choose a piece and finish his turn. In such a case at that very 
                    moment his opponent may say "Quarto" having noticed the line and win.
                    In the other case this line is not considered as winning line and the 
                    game continues. When there is no winning lines saying "Quarto" leads to
                    a loss. If all the pieces were placed and nobody is the winner then game
                    ends with a tie.
